== Description ==

1. Upload plugin folder to '/wp-content/plugins/' directory

1. Now enjoy WP Drinking Age Gateway!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use this plugin? =
Activate the plugin, and modify the settings for your site.

= Will this impact my SEO (Google Ranking) =
A JavaScript gateway such as this will allow easy indexing by search engines. Search bots won’t run the JavaScript to
to activate the gateway, and so it will not appear for them at all. The script is executed after the page is loaded, and
the content is rendered.

= What source is used for legal drinking ages? =
Legal drinking ages by country are referenced from [ProCon.org](http://drinkingage.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=004294)

= Why the hastle, can't I just input a specific age? =
Plugins exist that allow you to set a specific age requirement for visitors. This is for worldwide alcohol brands. All countries don’t have the same drinking age.
So solutions where the gateway is based on a static entry age aren’t viable. An age, and location must be gathered by the gateway to determine if a user is credible
to enter the site. Tequila consumption in Mexico is legal 3 years earlier than it is for residents of California.
